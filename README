These are the statistics as reported in the paper of Wu and Moin,
"Transitional and turbulent boundary layer with heat transfer",
Physics of Fluids, 2010. The momentum-thickness Reynolds number 
Re_theta varies continuously from 80 to 1950.  Isosurfaces of
Q-criterion colored y^+ are found in the Images/ directory.
